    " An operator working behind the scoreboard of a inter cohort AlmaBetter cricket tournament, is responsible for updating the scores and points of each team. However, the operator is currently facing a challenge. He has been tasked with updating the total number of points gained by Team London, but he does not possess the necessary programming skills to complete this task. According to the tournament's rules, teams are awarded the following points based on the outcome of a match:\n",

The operator is in need of assistance to calculate the total number of points earned by Team London.
